    I believe that in the field of social work we are confronted with issues with which, for whatever reason, we personally connect.  If this is so, when we find ourselves to be in a challenging ethical or moral situation, it is crucial that we possess sufficient self-awareness to ensure we do not allow personal biases to impact our relationship or work with a client.
    </p>

    <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure">
      Because we are social beings we each have ways we believe the world should be and have preferences in our ethical decisions.  However, this being so, we also need to respect the fact that our client probably has been raised within a set of different experiences that shape their outlook.  Mutual respect is necessary.  If we personally find the details of a case or situation are too much for us because of own experience, as a professional social worker it becomes important for use to recognize what is happening and refer the client to someone better able to deal with the facts at hand and provide unbiased case management.  To this day, I rarely have experienced such a moral dilemma in my interaction with a client.  But when I feel myself to be overwhelmed or frustrated, I make an effort to use my self-awareness to recognize it is time for me to take a moment to myself, calm down, and collect myself before proceeding.
    </p>
    <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure">
      I believe my passion is my primary personal and professional strength.  It seems able to help me comprehend present social injustice through an historical lens.  I find myself better able to connect with the marginalized population with whom I am working if I have worked to understand the adversities their community has previously experienced and the barriers they still face, today.  I believe that by knowing the history of oppression on an interpersonal and policy level I am better able me to serve as an advocate for whomever it is I am working.
    </p>
    <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure">
      Another of my strengths is using my academic knowledge of social work theory and practice tools to better understand the behaviors of those with whom I work.  This seems to help not to take anything too personally or perceive a negative behavior outside its context.
    </p>
    <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure">
      I’ve attended two Trauma Informed Care educational opportunities.  They have enhanced my ability to understand the students with whom I worked during my internship in this past year.  I believe they will help be a better social worker in the future.  I have reason to believe I am a dedicated to be a life-long learner. I certainly aspire to be.
    </p>
    <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure">
      My personal and professional weakness is a tendency to make my scope of change overly broad.  I have a variety social justice interests, e.g. policies involving low-income families, the school-to-prison pipeline, adult and juvenile justice systems, persons with disabilities, and public education in low-income communities.  I am coming to realize that, realistically, my efforts will be strengthened if I focus one area to work in at a time.  My dilemma is that it seems obvious to me that there is so much work to be done and many areas of social injustice that impact the future of the students and families with which I work that it is hard for me to focus all of my efforts on one cause.
    </p>
    <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure">
      Professionally, I am passionate, hardworking, creative, and empathetic when it comes to barriers for individuals, families, and communities to thrive in low-income communities.  I believe in interdisciplinary approaches when I work with clients to achieve goals.  I am a strong believer in using the student/teacher approach, keeping in mind that the clients are the experts when it comes to their lives.  While I am eager to work on a clinical level, I also believe in advocating on all levels—micro, mezzo, and macro—to create sustainable change in communities.
