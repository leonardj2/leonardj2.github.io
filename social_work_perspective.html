        Strengths-Based Theory focuses on a client’s strengths rather than using a deficit approach, one that solely focuses on the presenting problems.  Use of strengths-based theory allows for the social worker and the client to maintain a positive relationship.  The client feels that even though they are seeing a social worker, which typically is at a challenging time in one’s life, there still are positive things the social worker sees in them.  A strengths-based approach relies on the ability of a person to identify strengths and help the client accomplish objectives and goals.

        I was able to utilize strengths-based theory when I worked with a parent to help her build her résumé earlier this year.  This family had been brought to my attention because the woman’s son had been experiencing attachment issues while at school.  He complained about feeling sick and wanting to be with his parents.  Because the student was a Kindergartner it wouldn’t be all that unusual, except he was reported to have been fine at the beginning of the year.  Here it was three months into the school year and suddenly he was having these issues.  We decided it was important to try to connect with his parents in order to better understand how we might help him while he was in school.

      What we learned was that the boy’s father had been diagnosed with a terminal disease and the son was aware of it.  His mother shared a great deal of information with us.  In the process she asked if we might help her work on her résumé.  She was going to have to go back to work because the father had been the sole breadwinner in their household.  Of course, we agreed.

     The woman was pessimistic about her ability to do much.  She didn’t feel that she could represent herself as workforce asset—that she didn’t have much to contribute.  While it was true she didn’t have abundant work experience, I was able to explain to her what I perceived to be some of her positive attributes.  For example, I pointed out how she had taken time on numerous occasions to advocate for her son’s specific needs in school.  She had demonstrated an ability to care for both her son and her husband during a trying time.  I noted that she always had been a kind and uplifting spirit when I encountered her at school.  I told her that she had demonstrated through her leadership of a school beautification project that she possessed great ability to set her mind to something and follow through.

      After hearing me say these things, her attitude toward herself switched.  Suddenly she was able to share with us about the things she had accomplished while in school herself and things she had done to boost her work skills years after she had left the work force.  This mother was able to set realistic goals for herself in her search for work and ended up getting a job not more than a month after she met with us.

      General Systems Theory explains how larger systems are comprised of various smaller systems, all interacting within an individual’s framework of life.  For example, a student can be impacted by a variety of systems, including family, friends, school, sports, a religious institution, their community, a school system, and the government.

      When I worked with students at Overby-Sheppard Elementary School, I relied upon systems theory in order to better understand the root cause of our school’s struggles to achieve.  I was able to look at an individual student, their teacher, their family, and what they were experiencing in life.  I could put it in the context of their community’s history and that of Richmond Public Schools, especially in the context of public education policy.  I realized that many of the issues that our Overby-Sheppard faces result from a broken school system.  Because of inadequate funding, the school system suffers from an inability to provide students what they need to succeed.  Our school lacks sufficient and appropriate resources to provide individual counseling to combat trauma or to meet the needs of students with intellectual disabilities.  The inadequacy of quality educational resources is apparent.  We aren’t able to provide many of the resources families should have in a low-income community.  We lack an appropriate amount of resources or personnel as allotted by the Richmond Public School system in accordance with national policies and regulations.
