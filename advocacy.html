      The social work profession is multi-faceted and advocacy is the most essential.  As social workers we are called to be advocates for those whose voices have been silenced or ignored.  Often working with marginalized populations, social work seeks, in part, to attain social justice for all persons.
    </p>
    <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure mb4">
      Social workers have a unique opportunity to use their professional background in representing oppressed populations.  They accomplish this, first, by understanding the social injustices that their clients experience.  Social workers also empathize with those experiencing social injustice and direct them to resources that can provide immediate relief.  Social workersâ€™ knowledge of policy and our relationships with politicians, lobbyists, and other pertinent governing persons can be used to advocate for reforms where our experience shows they are due.  Until social policies meet the needs of all persons, there will continue to be oppressed populations experiencing injustice around the world.
    </p>
    <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure">
     It is imperative that responsible social workers provide their clients up-to-date interventions.  To do requires social workers to continue educating themselves in theory, social work practice, and policy as it changes and evolves throughout our careers.  Life-long learning can be achieved by a professional social worker attending workshops and conferences, seeking opportunities to be further certified, and/or continuing their formal education.  Society is ever-changing social and social workers must continue to learn in order to remain competent and use best practice strategies in working with their clients.
