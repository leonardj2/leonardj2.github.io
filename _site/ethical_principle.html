        According to the National Association of Social Workers’ Code of Ethics,
      </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-ns lh-copy measure i pl4 bl bw1 b--gold mb4">
      “Social workers respect and promote the right of clients to self-determination and assist clients in their efforts to identify and clarify their goals. Social workers may limit clients’ right to self-determination when, in the social workers’ professional judgment, clients’ actions or potential actions pose a serious, foreseeable, and imminent risk to themselves or others.”

    </p>
    <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure mb4">
    Throughout my time as a social work intern with Communities in Schools, I worked with students and families who would set different goals and objectives as part of their student’s success plans.  Each plan represents an effort to assess a particular student’s desires and specific needs for positive development in school.  While often I am able to identify the particular barriers to a student’s ability to thrive in school, if the student doesn’t see them or the parent doesn’t express concern about a specific attendance, behavior, or course completion objective that I have in mind, it wouldn’t be beneficial for me to insist that we work on it together.  Clients have the right to self-determination in identifying and clarifying their goals.  This is not due to some theory of right to self-determination. Instead, it is a practical recognition that if I, as the social worker, do not listen to my student and go ahead and set goals for them myself, I run the risk of losing the rapport we have developed.  More important, I also would be setting them up for failure because its not their goal, but mine.  Failure comes at a high cost: their loss of motivation to, or belief in their ability, to make positive change.

  </p>

  <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure">
   For example, when I worked with a student and mother on a student success plan this year, there were areas where I was certain the child would benefit from development of more pro-social behaviors.  However, until the mother or the student states this is something they believe they need or want, it is not in any of our best interest to raise the subject or set to goals with that outcome in mind.  As I continued to work with this family and to serve as an advocate to voice their concerns for the child’s success in school, we ended up working on the goal I originally had in mind.  This came about because the mother and student decided it was something they wanted to work on, were able to fully commit themselves to, and we achieved some success.
