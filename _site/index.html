      My formal education in social work began at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) in 2013.  Growing up, my parents and friends observed that what I most seemed to care about was helping those around me - friends, classmates, neighbors, friends of friends, etc.  One of my school counselors has since confirmed that, sometimes, this took priority over my schoolwork although I fared well academically.  I simply found life to be more rewarding when those around me were happy and healthy.  This continues to ring true today.
    </p>
    <p>
     During my time at VCU, I’ve learned to merge my inclination to help others with professional social work practice, theory, and tools.  I was fortunate in my opportunity to serve as an intern with Greater Richmond Fit4Kids during my junior year and with Communities in Schools of Richmond (CIS) at Overby-Sheppard Elementary School as a senior.  Each internship deepened my appreciation and understanding of families who live in low-income communities.  In these encounters, I discovered there are natural impediments to their ability to succeed that I, as a social worker, can identify, appreciate, direct resources toward, and address as an advocate for policy reform that will better meet the needs in their communities.
    </p>

      My desire to become a school social worker increased during my time with CIS.  I was asked to focus on attendance, behavior, and course completion among students in the small caseload I was given.  The barriers associated with their living in a low-income community arose among all of these focus areas.  It soon became evident to me through working with students and staff that public education and opportunities to thrive differ among students and families in low-income communities than those living in middle-high income communities.  The frustrations and challenges I faced day after day seemed to me to be the consequence of a fragmented system badly in need of reform.  I want to first help mitigate this disparity and, through advocacy, ameliorate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am saddened that my time spent with CIS as an undergrad will come to an end in May 2017.  However my social work education will continue within VCU’s Advanced Standing Master of Social Work program in the summer of 2017.  By spring 2018, I expect to have been awarded my Masters degree and School Social Work certification.  I should be adequately prepared to begin a career during which I can expect to continually be challenged as a school social worker.
